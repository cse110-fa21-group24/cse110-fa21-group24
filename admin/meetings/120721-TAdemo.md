# Questions

- Is the default scale always 1?
  - Spoonacular sometimes gives 2 servings as a default, so need to adjust
  - Go back to default button
- Can we untruncate the recipe names or make the recipe card bigger?
- Remove the links from the description
- Can users edit recipes everywhere and save the recipe if the recipe wasn't originally in the cookbook?
- Can users create a cookbook on the fly?

# To-Do

- Reset button to go back to default for scaling
- Remove links from description
- Merge extra filters

# Probably won't get to do
