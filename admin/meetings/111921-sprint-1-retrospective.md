### Meeting Notes

- What went well
  - A lot of people were able to offer help
  - Felt comfortable to reach out
  - Psychological safety!
  - A lot of people were able to ask for help
  - Good meeting attendance
  - Good organization with project board and issues
  - Easy to pick up issues
- What didnt't go well
  - Code became fragmented through small issues that could have been better paired together (leads to refactoring later)
  - UI development (no standard)
- What should we change or improve
  - Squash and merge with PRs rather than merge
  - Structure issues so they don't rely on other issues (label in potential solutions how issues can be split amongst others)
  - Potential issue to refactor for UI
  - Review PRs to learn code as well!
