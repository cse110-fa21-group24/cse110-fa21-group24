### Meeting Notes
- Explore features: Homepage and explore can be repetitive 
- Related recipes: Stretch 
- Search by
	- Filter: 
		Only include the most important tag
	- Customer tag could be made
		API includes filtering features
- Form smaller groups: Finalize the which features to keep
- Cookbooks: Add recipe -> explore page -> add recipe to the cookbooks
- Create a new cookbook
  - Ex: add bookmarks
  - Search recipe inside the cookbook
  - Can be stored locally 
- Recipe:From the API
- Prep time, cook time
- Edit the recipe:
	- Add the option of editing the recipe
	- Edit option on the recipe page 
	- The recipe should be in the cookbook first 
- Limited tech experiences:
	- Solution: plus buttons, a lot of picture, learn more button
	- Accessibility features: stretch feature 
- Sign in: 
	- Optional feature 
	- Data base
- Share the recipe without the sign in 
	- Share between different devices
		- export as pdf file 
		- suggestions: email the recipe 
			- google sign in store the recipe from 
- Questions:
	- Using API for search recipe : Users donâ€™t have the option to create a recipe
	- How to save the cookbook?: Save locally
    - If we have time: centralized data base, MongoDB
	- Why would we need a data base?
    	- For the sign in features
- the mobile version
  - working on the web version and the mobile in parallel
