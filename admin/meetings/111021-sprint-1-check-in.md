### Meeting Notes

- Stories

  - establish IndexedDB

    - main idea: need a flexible way to create functions for our buttons without getting to specific
    - research indexeddb
    - create flexible interface in which front end can make calls to

  - Spoonacular api
    - need to look into api key security issues
    - interface should be easier than the indexeddb

- Linters/PR flow

  - on PR there are checks
  - must pass checks in order to merge (for consistency)
  - can comment on PRs and request reviews
  - need two approvals in order to merge as well
  - must re-check code after change requests are made and fulfilled
  - will eventually set up a javascript check (Jest)

- VSCode Extensions
  - Prettier code formatter
  - formats upon command and can be configured upon save
  - Stylelint
  - run npm install stylelint stylelint-config-standard
  - highlights "errors" in CSS files
